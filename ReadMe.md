# Project 5: Auction

### Group Members: Joel Gloetzner, Roshan Subedi, Aayush Kafle, Atah Omar

## How To Start

- To start, you first run the Bank.java file and get the host name and port
- Then you run AuctionHouse.java. You can run it multiple times to get multiple auction houses
- It will ask for the bank host name and port number, you would enter it in and it will connect
- It then will display the items for sale
- Then you want to run Agent.java any number of times as you want
- It will ask for the bank info, then it will ask what auction house you want to connect too
- You will enter the host name and the port for the desired auction house

## Testing

- We were testing stuff locally and we had a BankTest to make sure the Bank is setup correctly
